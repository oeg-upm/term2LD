In this repository we share the progress towards an automatic service for the conversion and linking of interoperable terminological resources. 
1. Terminology Conversion to the Ontolex-lemon model:  the conversion of glossaries from the Catalan Terminology Centre TERMCAT, a highly relevant resource at a national level, and IATE, the most relevant terminological database at a European level.
2. Terminology Linking: the development of Entity Matching algorithm with the aim of unambiguously linking the converted resources mentioned above with other relevant ones, such as EuroVoc.
