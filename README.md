# Conversion and Linking of Terminological Resources in the Context  of Language Data Spaces
In this repository we share the progress towards an automatic service for the conversion and linking of interoperable terminological resources. 
1. Terminology Conversion to the Ontolex-lemon model:  the conversion of glossaries from the Catalan Terminology Centre TERMCAT, a highly relevant resource at a national level, and IATE, the most relevant terminological database at a European level.
2. Terminology Linking: the development of Entity Matching algorithm with the aim of unambiguously linking the converted resources mentioned above with other relevant ones, such as EuroVoc.
